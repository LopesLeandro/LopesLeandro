Specialist in risk management and compliance, trained on lead implementer and internal auditor of the integrated compliance and anti-bribery management system, by ABNT based on ISO 37.301 and 37.001, internationally recognized standards, including a strong knowledge with ISO 31.000, 27.001 and privacy laws.
Professional with over 9 years of experience in audit, risk management and compliance, entrusted with the duty of building risk, compliance and internal audit programs to prevent, detect and remedy conducts that do not comply with the values of the company and Brazilian legislation, in addition to disseminating, not only the corporate culture and knowledge about the organization governance at all levels, but also risk-based thinking, with the aim to enable employees to face ethical dilemmas in decision-making and in carrying out their activities. 
Particularlly, it is intense and stimulating preparing this program to protect and create value, writing all this theoretical material to convert it into practical actions and solutions, and then establishing the processes and activities, and disseminating them to all interested parts.
The opportunity to work in research to implement the best models is the great differential of this phase of my career, provided by Krona. Being a scientist; following this simple set of rules of questioning everything, researching, testing ideas through experiments and observation, developing approved ideas following the evidence wherever it takes us, recording the knowledge gained in advisory materials and disseminating it to any audience interested in listening. It is a wish fulfilled and I am really glad and proud of my pathway, until now.
